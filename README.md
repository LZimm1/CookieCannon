# Cookie Cannon

Submission to Low-Quality Game Jam 7: Cookie. 
There's nothing more low quality than unoriginality, so I decided to implement the theme of cookies into an already-imagined mobile game but as a web game. I don't know the specific name of the game, but I know that there are many clones, as there are for most mobile games.
